Here are the rules to the drinking game:
- everyone puts their head down
- on the count of three, everyone looks up at someone else in the group
- if your selected person is also looking at you, you both drink
- if there are no pairs, everyone drinks

The question is: given a group size N, what is the probability that you drink?
